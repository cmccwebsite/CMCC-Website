                In 1990s, the population in Richmond increased dramatically and so did the number of Catholics. The three parishes in the city were not big enough to meet this growth. So in 1995, the Most Reverend Adam Exner OMI, Archbishop of Vancouver, bought the land in northern Richmond located in Granville Avenue and No. 2 Road which was previously the site of an old Baptist Church, and converted it to a new Catholic Church.
                <br><br>
                The new Parish was named "Canadian Martyrs Catholic Church" in order to commemorate the eight Jesuit martyrs from France in the 17th century. They were Father Jean De Brebeuf, Isaac Jogues, Antoine Daniel, Gabriel Lalemant, Charles Garnier and Noel Chabanel and two lay companions. In Canada, their feast day is celebrated on September 26.
                <br><br>
                The parish property is about 2.2 acres. The original facility was built in 1967. After interior and exterior renovations, adding more equipment and religious articles, there were 355 seats which was enough for 400 parishioners. In addition, there was the parish office, a conference room, kitchen, community room and some classrooms. It became a well equipped church that served the community well.
                <br><br>
                The parish population expanded rapidly and soon outgrew the original building. Plans were developed and funds were raised to build a larger church facility. On May 5, 2001 the last mass was celebrated in the old building. After that, everything had to be moved out and put into storage. The parish community spent the next 22 months worshipping at the nearby parishes of St. Joseph the Worker and St. Paul's.
                <br><br>
                The new 600 seat Church and adjacent Parish Centre were officially opened on March 2, 2003.
                <br><br>
                Canadian Martyrs Parish is located in the centre of the city. It is the only Catholic Church in Richmond where masses are offered in Mandarin, Cantonese and English. There are about 1200 registered families and the number is increasing.

                踏入九十年代，列治文人口急剧上升，教友人数相应增加。市内原有的三个堂区感不敷应用，有见及此，温哥华总主教（Most Reverend Adam Exner OMI）于1995年斥资购置入位于列市北部，加连威老道（Granville Ave.）夹头二路的前浸信会旧址，改建为天主教堂区。
                <br><br>
                新堂区命名为“加拿大殉道圣人天主堂”，目击的为尊崇纪念八位，于十七世纪抵制​​达加拿大传教而殉道的法国耶稣会会士。他们分别是圣若望，卜瑞柏及依撒格，饶格等殉道圣人们。 (Father Jean De Brebeuf, Isaac Jogues, Antoine Daniel, Gabriel Lalemant, Charles Garnier and Noel Chabanel and Two Lay Companions) 每年九月廿六日为主保瞻礼。
                <br><br>
                教区在1995年购入的堂区物业，占地约一公顷。初期的教堂是建于1967年的单层建筑物。其后拆掉原址 重建，全新教堂在2003年落成祝圣，设有座位620个。
                <br><br>
                堂区行政架构：本堂已成立的堂区议事会，由华人及不同族裔代表组成，协助主任司铎厘定方针， 促进堂区运作。此外设秘书一名，财政小组和筹款小组等。
                <br><br>
                堂区位于交通主要枢纽，目前是列治文城唯一设有国，粤英语弥撒的堂区，已登记教友家庭约600户，且续有增加加1400户。
